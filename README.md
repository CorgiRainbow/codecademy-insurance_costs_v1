U.S. Medical Insurance Costs


Looking at a database of insurance costs by customer profile, I would like to see if it's possible to identify:


What are the highest insurance cost averages for each of the categorical variables (sex, smoker and region).

Expected outputs
"The average insurance costs for males is x, whereas the average insurance cost for females is y."
"The average insurance costs for smokers is x, whereas the average insurance cost for non-smokers is y."
"The average insurance costs based on region is: northwest x, northeast y, southwest w, southeast z"


For numerical variables, such as age, BMI and number of kids, I'd like to group them and compare insurance costs.
Age: Count the amount of people for each individual age.
BMI: Use standard classification of 'low', 'normal', 'overweight' and 'obese', depending on BMI values.
Number of kids: Create groups for each different amount of children.


From the analysis above, detect which customer groups have the highest insurance costs and merge them into one final group. For an insurance company, the goal could be to target this group with motivational messaging about adopting better lifestyle habits.
