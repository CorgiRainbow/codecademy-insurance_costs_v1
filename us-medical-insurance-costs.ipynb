    "With the data above, we can say that smokers have much higher average insurance costs compared to non-smokers, as the average insurance cost for smokers is about 3.8 times that of non-smokers. Even though the sample size for smokers is smaller (274 vs. 1064 non-smokers), the significant cost difference likely reflects the higher health risks associated with smoking, which leads to higher insurance premiums. Despite the smaller sample size, this pattern suggests a strong correlation between smoking status and increased insurance costs."

This may be due to the increased health risks associated with obesity, which typically result in higher medical expenses. The larger sample size of 705 customers in the “obese” category further strengthens this observation, as it indicates that the higher average cost isn’t due to a small, potentially unrepresentative group but reflects a broader trend in the dataset."
